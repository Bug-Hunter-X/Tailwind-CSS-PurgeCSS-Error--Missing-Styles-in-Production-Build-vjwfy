This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js, and it involves incorrect purging of unused CSS classes during the build process.  The error might manifest as missing styles or unexpected rendering issues on the client-side.  The root cause is often a mismatch between where Tailwind CSS is configured (e.g., `tailwind.config.js`) and where your components are actually being imported or used.
